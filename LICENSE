### POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC LICENSES:

### liblo (0.31)
- License: LGPL-2.1+ ⚠️ (GNU Lesser General Public License)
- Repository: https://github.com/radarsat1/liblo
- Copyright: Copyright (C) 2014 Steve Harris et al.
- CONCERN: LGPL requires that users can replace/relink the LGPL library
- MITIGATION: LGPL allows linking with MIT code as long as liblo remains dynamically linked

### LYGIA GLSL Library
- License: Prosperity Public License 3.0.0 ❌ (NON-COMMERCIAL ONLY)
- Repository: https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia
- Copyright: Patricio Gonzalez Vivo (patriciogonzalezvivo.com)
- CRITICAL ISSUE: 
  * 30-day trial period for commercial use
  * Requires separate commercial license after trial
  * Makes this project NON-COMMERCIAL ONLY under current license structure

================================================================================
LICENSE COMPATIBILITY CONCLUSION
================================================================================

❌ CANNOT USE MIT LICENSE FOR COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

This project CANNOT be distributed under MIT license for commercial use due to:

1. LYGIA Prosperity License 3.0.0 restricts commercial use to 30-day trial
2. Commercial distribution requires separate LYGIA commercial license

RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS:

OPTION 1 - Non-Commercial Distribution:
- Change project license to match LYGIA's non-commercial terms
- Keep LGPL compliance for liblo (dynamic linking)
- Clearly mark as "Non-Commercial Use Only"

OPTION 2 - Commercial Distribution:
- Obtain commercial license for LYGIA from patriciogonzalezvivo@gmail.com
- Keep current MIT license once commercial LYGIA license acquired
- Maintain LGPL compliance for liblo

OPTION 3 - Remove LYGIA Dependency:
- Replace LYGIA with MIT-compatible shader library
- Return to pure MIT licensing
- Maintain LGPL compliance for liblo only

CURRENT PROJECT STATUS: NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY
